# Terminal Cat

My first repo here.

Basically creates a simple animation of a cat that moves back and forth
across the terminal window, blinking its eyes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. This code is intended
for Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.

## Compilation

To compile the program, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
gcc -o terminal_cat main.c
```

## Running the Program

After compilation, you can run the program by executing:

```bash
./terminal_cat
```

## What It Does

The program will clear your terminal screen and display a cat that moves from
one side of the terminal to the other, blinking its eyes. The animation runs in
an infinite loop and can be stopped by pressing `CTRL+C`.

Enjoy!
